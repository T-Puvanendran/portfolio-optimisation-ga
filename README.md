# Portfolio Optimisation using Genetic Algorithms

This is my final year project exploring the use of **genetic algorithms** to solve a **portfolio optimisation** problem.

The optimisation model is written in **AMPL**, and the project includes a full **LaTeX report** and a **PowerPoint presentation** summarising the results.
